# User interface for using digital signature
This project contains the user interface for digitally signing documents and validating standard digital signatures created with this application. This is just a user interface, the work is done by the underlying library StandardDigitalSignature

This is a demonstration of the use of digital signature for the software developer, in this user interface you can find the following examples:

## 1) Sign a document
The example for digitally signing a document in a very simple and minimalist way is contained entirely on page Signature.razor.
The digital signature is placed on a separate file keeping the original document unaltered which will continue to be viewable with a standard viewer. The validation of the signature then takes place by subjecting both files to verification: The original document and the separate file with the digital signature generated by this tool.

## 2) Digital signature validation
A simple example of digital signature validation is contained in page SignatureValidation.razor.
To verify the digital signature, you need the original document, plus the attached file with the digital signature. In the case of multiple digital signatures, there will therefore be multiple digital signature files, each generated by each individual person who signed the document.
